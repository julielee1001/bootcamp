# Homework: Arrays and Hashes in Ruby

#### Requirements 
- add solution for both task 1 and task 2  to script.rb file
- include comments to explain your code and the expected output for each task.

**Task 1: Arrays**

1. Create an array named fruits that contains the following fruits: "apple," "banana," "cherry," "date," "fig," "grape."
2. Print the entire array.
3. Print the first and last elements of the array.
4. Add "kiwi" to the end of the array.
5. Remove "cherry" from the array.
6. Print the modified array.
7. Check if "apple" is in the array and print the result.
8. Calculate and print the total number of fruits in the fruits array.

**Stretch Goal:**
1. Ask the user to input a fruit, and then check if that fruit is in the array. Print the result.
2. Sort the fruits array in alphabetical order and print the sorted list.

**Task 2: Hashes**

1. Create a hash named student with the following key-value pairs:
- "name" => "John Smith"
- "age" => 25
- "major" => "Computer Science"
Print the entire hash.
2. Print only the value associated with the "name" key.
3. Add a new key-value pair to the hash: "gpa" => 3.7.
4. Update the "age" value to 26.
5. Print the modified hash.
6. Check if the hash contains a key "gender" and print the result.

**Stretch Goal:**
_Combining Arrays and Hashes_
1. Create a new array called students that contains multiple student hashes (e.g., data for multiple students).
2. Use a loop to print the name and major of each student in the students array.
